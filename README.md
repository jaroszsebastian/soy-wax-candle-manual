**4.1 Prepare Workspace**
- Clear your workspace for a clutter-free environment.
- Cover the work surfaces with protective sheeting.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure good ventilation in the area.

**4.2 Prepare Container**
- Wash the heat-resistant container.
- Dry the container thoroughly. 

**4.3 Melt Wax**
- Melt soy wax flakes in a double boiler.
  - Stir occasionally.
- Heat wax to 170-180°F (76-82°C).
  - Use a thermometer to monitor.
> [!CAUTION]
> Never leave melting wax unattended to prevent fire hazards. 

**4.4 Install Wick**
- Secure the wick to the base of the container using hot wax or an adhesive.
- Center the wick using a centering tool.
> [!NOTE]
> If you do not have a centering tool, you can use two chopsticks.

**4.5 Pour Wax**
> [!NOTE]
> If you want to add dye or fragrance, do it at 140°F (60°C) and stir all the ingredients until they dissolve.
- Pour the wax into the heat-resistant container leaving space at the top.
  - Ensure the wick remains centered. 
> [!WARNING]
> Pour wax slowly to avoid spills.

**4.6 Finish Candle**
- Let the candle cool undisturbed for 24 hours.
- Trim the wick to about ¼ inch for an even burn.

## 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

:o: **Sinkholes**
> _**Issue:**_ Sinkholes appear in the wax near the wick or at the candle's surface as it cools.<br>
> _**Solution:**_ Gently reheat the surface of the candle with a heat gun or place it in a warm oven to melt the top layer. Alternatively, pour a second layer of slightly cooler wax over the first to fill in any gaps.
  
:o: **Wick Burning Too Quickly or Too Slowly**
> _**Issue:**_ The wick burns too fast, resulting in a short candle life, or too slowly, causing an inadequate melt pool.<br>
> _**Solution:**_ Ensure you are using the correct wick size for your candle's diameter. Thicker wicks are needed for wider candles, and thinner wicks are suitable for smaller candles. Adjust the wick size accordingly in future batches.

:o: **Poor Scent Throw**
> _**Issue:**_ The candle does not emit much fragrance when lit.<br>
> _**Solution:**_ Increase the fragrance oil ratio slightly within the manufacturer's recommended limits. Ensure the wax is not too hot when adding fragrance oils, as high temperatures can cause the fragrance to evaporate.

:o: **Wick Has Drowned**
> _**Issue:**_ The wick is too short, becoming submerged in the wax as the candle burns.<br>
> _**Solution:**_ Trim the wick to about ¼ inch above the wax surface before the initial burn. For future batches, ensure the wick is securely attached and stands upright, or consider using a longer wick.

## 6. Quality Control Measures
> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Consistent Measurements:** Always measure fragrance oils and dye by weight rather than volume for consistency.
> - **Test Burns:** Conduct test burns with new candle batches to ensure proper burn quality, including the melt pool's size and how evenly the candle burns.
> - **Visual Checks:** Regularly inspect the color, consistency, and surface of the candles for any signs of issues like frosting or separation, which could indicate improper mixing or temperature control.
